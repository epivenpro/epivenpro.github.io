Let's see how this thing works.

Don't go too crazy on me. After all, this is a first post.

Let me introduce myself [here](/about). Yeah, I know, making a separate page about myself
DOES seem a little braggy, but hey, it's MY site (-

First, I just wanted to try some Puppet code injections:

```puppet
define accounts::base (
  Enum[present, absent]   $ensure    = present,
  Stdlib::Unixpath        $shell     = '/bin/bash',
  Optional[String]        $fullname  = undef,
  Pattern[/^06[046]{2}$/] $home_mode = '0640',
  Array[String]           $groups    = [],
  Optional[Integer]       $uid       = undef,
  Optional[Integer]       $gid       = undef,
) { }
```

Nice. How about some Ruby now?

```ruby
require 'puppetlabs_spec_helper/module_spec_helper'

fixture_path = File.expand_path(File.join(__FILE__, '..', 'fixtures'))

RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.formatter     = :documentation
  c.module_path   = File.join(fixture_path, 'modules')
  c.manifest_dir  = File.join(fixture_path, 'manifests')
  c.default_facts = {
    :operatingsystem => 'Ubuntu',
  }
  c.after(:suite) do
    RSpec::Puppet::Coverage.report!
  end
end
```
